# Text-Based-Emotion-Recognition
### • Developed a text-based emotion recognition system that classifies sentences into eight emotion categories
 leveraging both Logistic Regression and BERT to enhance accuracy and contextual understanding
 
### • Implemented advanced preprocessing techniques(stop word removal,tokenization) and fine-tuned
 BERT for emotion specific classification, improving model performance over traditional methods
 
### • Conducted thorough error analysis, identifying misclassifications such as ’disgust’and’surprise,’and
 proposed solutions like contextual embeddings and improved feature extraction to enhance accuracy
